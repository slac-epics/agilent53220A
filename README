Keysight 53220A/230A Universal Frequency Counter/Timer 
Also known as the Agilent 53220A/230A Universal Frequency Counter/Timer
The controls interface will be via ethernet over a remote interface 
using the SCPI programming language.


The 53220A/53230A is a 2U, 1/2-module width LXI Class C instrument. The 2U,
1/2-module width references refer to the 53220A/53230Aâ€™s physical size relative to
standard EIA rack cabinet dimensions. LXI, an acronym for LAN eXtensions for
Instrumentation, is an instrumentation standard for devices that use the Ethernet (LAN)
as their primary remote communications interface.
